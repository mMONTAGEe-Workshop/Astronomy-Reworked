      <h3 className={styles.h3}>Sol, Our sun</h3>
      <p className={styles.p}>At the center of our Solar System, we encounter a radiant marvel—the Sun. It serves as a radiant beacon, a colossal star illuminating our cosmic neighborhood. The Sun's immense gravitational pull binds the planets, moons, and other celestial bodies, while its fierce heat and radiant light bestow life-giving energy upon Earth.</p>
      <p className={styles.p}>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that constitutes about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs. The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich, star. The formation of the Sun may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae. This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star.</p>

      <p className={styles.p}>the closest planet to the Sun, is a small, rocky world with a barren and inhospitable surface. Its proximity to the Sun means that it experiences extreme temperatures, ranging from scorching hot during the day to freezing cold at night. Mercury has a heavily cratered surface and no atmosphere to shield it from solar radiation. Despite its small size, Mercury possesses a large iron core, making it one of the densest planets in the Solar System.</p>

      <p className={styles.p}>often referred to as Earth's sister planet, is similar in size and composition but has a vastly different environment. It is shrouded in a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. Venus has a scorching hot surface, with temperatures high enough to melt lead, making it the hottest planet in our Solar System. Its atmosphere also produces a dense layer of clouds, making Venus the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon.</p>

      <p className={styles.p}>Our home planet, Earth, is a haven for life as we know it. It boasts a diverse range of ecosystems and a breathable atmosphere that sustains a rich tapestry of life forms. Earth is the only known planet to support a complex biosphere, with vast oceans, lush forests, and diverse landscapes. It orbits at an optimal distance from the Sun, allowing for the presence of liquid water—a key ingredient for life.</p>
      <p className={styles.p}>Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.</p>

      <p className={styles.p}>Often called the "Red Planet" due to its rusty-colored surface, Mars has long captured the imagination of scientists and explorers. It is a cold and arid planet with a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. Mars features striking geological features, including the largest volcano and deepest canyon in the Solar System. Scientists have discovered evidence of ancient water on Mars, raising intriguing questions about the possibility of past life or the potential for future human exploration.</p>
      <p className={styles.p}>Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched down on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers). The Ingenuity helicopter rode to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance.</p>
